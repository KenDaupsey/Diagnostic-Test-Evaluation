# Diagnostic-Test-Evaluation

Introduction
This project aims to provide a practical implementation and understanding of various measures and metrics used to evaluate the performance of diagnostic tests. These measures are crucial in medical decision-making, as they help assess the accuracy, reliability, and effectiveness of diagnostic tests in identifying the presence or absence of a condition or disease.

Measures Covered
The project covers the following diagnostic test evaluation measures:

Sensitivity: The ability of a test to correctly identify individuals with the condition (true positive rate).
Specificity: The ability of a test to correctly identify individuals without the condition (true negative rate).
Positive Predictive Value (PPV): The probability that an individual has the condition given a positive test result.
Negative Predictive Value (NPV): The probability that an individual does not have the condition given a negative test result.
Kappa Statistic: A measure of agreement between two raters or diagnostic tests, accounting for chance agreement.
Accuracy: The overall proportion of correct diagnoses made by the test.
Recall (Sensitivity): The ability of the test to identify all individuals with the condition.
Precision: The ability of the test to identify only individuals with the condition (positive predictive value).
Likelihood Ratios: The ratio of the probability of a specific test result for individuals with the condition to the probability of the same result for individuals without the condition.
Diagnostic Odds Ratio: The ratio of the odds of a positive test result for individuals with the condition to the odds of a positive test result for individuals without the condition.
F1 Score: A harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric for overall test performance.
Setup
To run this project, you will need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
You can install these libraries using pip:


Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Open the Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the code.
Follow the instructions and examples provided to calculate and interpret the diagnostic test evaluation measures.
Modify the sample data or provide your own dataset to explore different scenarios.
Examples
The project includes code examples for each diagnostic test evaluation measure, demonstrating how to calculate and interpret the results using sample data. The examples are accompanied by detailed explanations and interpretations to aid in understanding the practical applications of these measures in medical diagnosis and decision-making.
